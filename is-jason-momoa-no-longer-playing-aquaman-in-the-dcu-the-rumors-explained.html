Here is everything we know so far.</p><h2 id=h-is-jason-momoa-still-playing-aquaman-in-the-dcu data-injectable=false>Is Jason Momoa still playing Aquaman in the DCU?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=388 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=540 data-current-count=928 data-injectable=true>As previously reported on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">We Got This Covered</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">originally shared by The Hollywood Reporter</a>, the change in management at DC Studios is causing a lot of behind-the-scenes shake-ups. There is currently a rumor floating around that suggests the new management’s desire to wrap up the Snyderverse-linked characters and plotlines will lead to characters like Aquaman not returning after their currently finished movies have been released. On top of this, several sequels in early production, like&nbsp;Wonder Woman 3,&nbsp;have been canceled.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=197 data-current-count=197 data-injectable=false>It should be noted that this does mean that Momoa will still be playing Aquaman in&nbsp;Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom, and that this movie will still be released as scheduled on December 25th, 2023.</p><h2 id=h-will-momoa-take-up-a-new-role-in-the-dcu data-injectable=false>Will Momoa take up a new role in the DCU?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=497 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=302 data-current-count=302 data-injectable=false>The second part of these rumors suggests that Momoa will not be done with the DCU when he hangs up the Aquaman costume. According to reports previously <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">covered on We Got This Covered</a>, some at the studio have suggested that Momoa transition into a new DC role, that of fan-favorite character <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lobo</a>.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=306 data-current-count=608 data-injectable=true>Fans have been crying out for the violent interstellar anti-hero bounty hunter to get a film for many years. The character has made countless appearances in DC media, being a fixture in the games and animated series and even making the jump to live-action in the often-overlooked series&nbsp;Krypton.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=541 data-current-count=541 data-injectable=false>It should be noted that these reports suggest these discussions are only in the early stage, and nothing is confirmed at the present time. Behind-the-scenes events could lead to these plans falling through or the new bosses at DC Studios opting to take a different approach. However, it isn’t outside the realm of possibility to think that, even if the studio doesn’t want to continue with the Snyderverse-linked&nbsp;Aquaman&nbsp;films, they will be keen to keep Jason Momoa on board due to the actor’s immense popularity.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooKxlmpbAsLqMpqamp5Fiu7B5y6iloJ2iYr2trdiipaBlkabCornAp2Sipl2ptaZ5w5ysZqyYmnqzwcyoqaxlla29ra3Ip5ydZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
