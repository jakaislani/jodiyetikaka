Anders Breivik, a far-right Norwegian fanatic, carried out a terrorist attack in 2011, murdering 77 people.</strong></p><p>He used a truck bomb in Oslo, followed by a shooting spree, to kill eight people and injure 69 others, largely young people, at a Labour Party youth camp. Breivik is currently serving Norway’s longest prison sentence of 21 years, although his sentence might be extended if authorities consider he is still a threat.</p><p>The newest focus on Anders Breivik has been on his legal case against the state, which alleges violations of his human rights as a result of his “extreme” isolation. Breivik had already sued the government in 2016, saying that it had violated the European Convention on Human Rights, which emphasizes the protection of individuals from torture or punishment.</p><h2>What Religion Does Anders Breivik Follow? Is He Religious?</h2><p>Breivik’s faith has caused enormous debate, particularly online, where doubts about his Christianity have become a hot topic. In 2011, Breivik declared himself a Protestant, saying, “At the age of 15, I chose to be baptized and confirmed,” and adding, “I consider myself to be 100 percent Christian.”</p><p>This declaration, however, was met with passionate hostility to the political viewpoints of the majority of Protestant churches and the Roman Catholic Church. Breivik professed his complete disaffection with Christianity in 2016, claiming that he had never been a Christian. According to his lawyer, ystein Storrvikthis, Anders Breivik’s faith was changed to Nazism when he was imprisoned</p><p>Despite media portrayals of Anders Breivik’s faith as a fundamentalist Christian, his internet comments challenged this label. Analyzing Anders Breivik’s religion revealed a shift away from Christian principles, with a focus on what appeared to be an atavistic fear of Muslims and Marxists.</p><p>Notably, he declared prayers and offerings to Odin to be part of the Anders Breivik religion, so identified himself with the Odinism spiritual system. This departure from traditional Christianity emphasized the difficulties of his developing religious identity. His comments and ideas have complicated the argument around Anders Breivik’s religion, pushing the public to confront the sensitive aspects of his spiritual development.</p><h2>Learn more about Anders Breivik’s Ethnicity and Place of Origin</h2><p>Anders Breivik was born in Oslo on February 13, 1979, into a household replete with fascinating complexities. Jens David Breivik, a well-known civil economist, began his diplomatic career in the Norwegian Embassies in London and Paris. Meanwhile, his mother, Wenche Behring, had a difficult life and left an abusive household when she was 17 years old.</p><p>Wenche Behring was in her thirties when she became pregnant with Anders, and she married Anders’ father, Jens Breivik, during a pivotal period in her life. Proud of his Norwegian ancestry and nationality, he developed a deep concern for Europe’s well-being. When he expressed alarm about what he dubbed “demographic Jihad” conducted by Islam, his position became problematic.</p><p>In his publications, Breivik argued that Islam’s influence and unrestrained Muslim immigration were endangering Europe’s existence. These elements, he believed, were changing Europe’s cultural milieu, culminating in what he regarded as Europe’s invasion. Breivik’s thoughts on these topics highlighted his strong sentiments about the intersection of culture, religion, and identity.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Lenny Kravitz Girlfriend, Gay, Children"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/lenny-kravitz-girlfriend-gay-children-race/"}{"1":50}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Lenny Kravitz Girlfriend, Gay, Children</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Trending News</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Haring Manggi Death Hoax, Arrested For Illegal Drugs Selling</a></h3>Haring Manggi, also known as Miguelito Malakas, is a well-known figure in his home country the Philippines.
