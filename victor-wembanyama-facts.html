The teenager has sparked “Wembymania” in his home country thanks to his unique blend of size, shooting skills, and ball-handling ability. And if that carries over to the NBA, San Antonio could be on the fast track to a turnaround after missing the playoffs the past four seasons. Read on to learn more about the young hoops phenom before his much-anticipated debut in the United States.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Basketball Greats</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=3 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">1. Wembanyama isn’t the only athlete in his family.<br></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Wembanyama’s athletic talent isn’t all that surprising given his family tree. His father, Félix Wembanyama, was a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/16/sport/victor-wembanyama-draft-lottery-profile-spt-intl/index.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="high jumper" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">high jumper</a>, according to CNN, and his mother, Elodie de Fautereau, is a former basketball player and current coach. His grandfather Michel de Fautereau played for the Paris University Club hoops team in France’s topflight league.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Victor tried other sports growing up like judo and football, but probably made the right decision sticking with basketball.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">2. He is already fluent in English.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Unlike a lot of foreign athletes who move to the United States to play professional sports, Wembanyama won’t have a language barrier. He taught himself English during his early teen years because he knew he would one day play in the NBA, and he believed it was the language of “basketball people.” According to the Associated Press, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://apnews.com/article/nba-draft-lottery-2023-wembanyama-spurs-pistons-rockets-7e95b8f804e9ec64e303debdc3a7b2d4 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="he learned" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">he learned</a> by watching English-speaking television shows.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">3. The coach who discovered him mistook him for another coach.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">According to Olympics.com, Wembanyama was <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://olympics.com/en/news/victor-wembanyama-fast-facts-player-star-nba-draft data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="first scouted" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">first scouted</a> while playing for a U11 team in Versailles, France. Michael Allard, a coach for the French professional team Nanterre 92, attended the game and was drawn to a figure on the bench with an impressively long frame. Assuming the person was an assistant coach, Allard was surprised to learn he was actually watching Wembanyama. Allard and the club wasted no time recruiting him for their youth program, and Wembanyama eventually made his professional debut with Nanterre in the 2019 EuroCup.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">4. He dominated his French league.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Wembanyama played for Metropolitans 92 of the LNB Pro A, the highest-tier league in French basketball. Although the league’s overall talent level doesn’t compare to that the NBA, it’s still a good sign for Wembanyama that he’s dominated his competition.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">According to Zach Kram of The Ringer, Wembanyama <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.npr.org/2023/05/16/1176506769/if-you-dont-know-basketballer-victor-wembanyama-you-will data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="led the league" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">led the league</a> in points, rebounds, and blocks this season as a teenager over games played through May 16. It’s even more impressive considering <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/victor-wembanyama-by-the-numbers-11-things-to-know-about-the-2023-nba-drafts-likely-no-1-pick/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="he missed" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">he missed</a> three months last season with a knee injury—meaning he played in less than half of his 66 possible games across Pro A and EuroLeague play.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">5.

Wembanyama has an artistic streak.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In addition to his basketball skills, Wembanyama might be a Renaissance man in the making. “I feel like I’m an artist on and off the court,” Wembanyama <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0AtpGv3zI0" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="said in an August 2022 interview with ESPN2" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">said in an August 2022 interview with ESPN2</a>. “I love thinking about a lot of things and working to get an art piece done… I love drawing.
