His father worked as a civil engineer, while his mother stayed home to take care of the kids. At school, Keaton displayed his interest in acting by performing humorous skits.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After attending Kent State University for two years, Keaton dropped out to pursue an acting career. He found work as a cab driver and an ice cream truck driver in his hometown for a while, as he tried his hand at stand-up comedy. In 1975, Keaton made his television debut on the children's series Mister Roger's Neighborhood, which was filmed in Pittsburgh. He later moved to Los Angeles, where he started to land some television work. Keaton changed his last name in order to prevent confusion between he and famous actor <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/michael-douglas data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Michael Douglas" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Michael Douglas</a>. In an interview in 2012, Keaton admitted he chose his famous surname quite randomly, despite the rumors that he was inspired by actress <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/diane-keaton data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Diane Keaton" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Diane Keaton</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Big Break</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1977, Keaton joined the cast of the sitcom All's Fair. He played a presidential aide in the short-lived series, which starred Richard Crenna and Bernadette Peters. After appearances on such shows as Mary, Maude and Family, Keaton landed a lead role in the comedy Working Stiffs. He and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/james-belushi data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jim Belushi" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jim Belushi</a> played brothers who worked as janitors. The show only lasted a month. In 1982, Keaton tried again for television success with Report to Murphy, a sitcom in which he played a parole officer. The program aired for a month and a half before being canceled.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While he couldn't find fame on television, Keaton was starting to experience success in films. He starred with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/henry-winkler data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Henry Winkler" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Henry Winkler</a> and Shelley Long in Night Shift (1982), a comedy directed by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/ron-howard data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ron Howard" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ron Howard</a>. The film told the story of two morgue workers who start using their workplace as a brothel. The film was met with critical success; co-star Winkler earned a Golden Globe for his performance, and Keaton was recognized with a Kansas City Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actor. Box office attendance, however, was low.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The following year, Keaton had a career breakthrough with the domestic comedy Mr. Mom, a film about a man who becomes a stay-at-home dad after losing his job. The film became his first big hit, grossing more than $64 million domestically.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Hollywood Star</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Keaton then starred in Johnny Dangerously (1984), a send-up of old gangster films. Unfortunately, the film received the cold shoulder from both critics and audiences alike. In 1986, Keaton again floundered with Gung Ho, which found humor in an American automotive plant after a takeover by a Japanese automaker. In 1988, however, Keaton proved his range as a performer with two very different films. He starred as a mischievous demon who helps a pair of ghosts (<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/alec-baldwin data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Alec Baldwin" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Alec Baldwin</a> and Geena Davis) get rid of a family that moved into their old house in Beetlejuice.

"Tim and I both have the same sensibility. He has this darkness and melancholy about him that's kind of funny. People weren't ready for that at the time," Keaton later explained to the Guardian newspaper.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Keaton showed off his ability to handle dramatic material in his next project, Clean and Sober. In the film, he played a real estate agent with a substance abuse problem. The National Society of Film Critics recognized Keaton for his nuanced performance by giving him the award for Best Actor in 1988.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Keaton moved to blockbuster fare in 1989, taking on the role of one of the country's most famous comic book characters in Batman (1989) and its sequel, Batman Returns (1992). The films reunited Keaton with director Burton, and Keaton played the famous Batman character with a darker edge than had been portrayed in previous incarnations. Keaton's Batman was edgy, moody and emotionally wounded. In the films, he battled such legendary bad guys as the Joker (played by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/jack-nicholson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jack Nicholson" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jack Nicholson</a>) and the Penguin (played by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/danny-devito data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Danny DeVito" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Danny DeVito</a>). <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/val-kilmer data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Val Kilmer " class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Val Kilmer </a>replaced Keaton for the third installment. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/george-clooney data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="George Clooney" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">George Clooney</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/christian-bale data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Christian Bale" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Christian Bale</a> also followed in Keaton's footsteps in the later Batman films.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1990, Keaton starred as psychopath tenant Carter Hayes/James Danforth in the thriller Pacific Heights, opposite Melanie Griffith and Matthew Modine.

That same year, he starred with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/nicole-kidman data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Nicole Kidman" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Nicole Kidman</a> in My Life, playing a man facing death from a terminal illness. Keaton starred in The Paper (1994) as a New York City newspaper editor. Again working a literary angle, he played as a political speechwriter in the romantic comedy Speechless (1994) opposite Davis. Keaton then starred in Harold Ramis's comedy Multiplicity as a man who able to make copies of himself. None of these films matched the success of his early hits, however.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1997, Keaton worked with director <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/quentin-tarantino data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Quentin Tarantino" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Quentin Tarantino</a> on the crime thriller Jackie Brown, a film adaptation of an Elmore Leonard novel.

He then starred in the 2002 television movie Live from Baghdad, about CNN reporters during the Gulf War. For his impressive work on the project, Keaton received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Performance by an Actor in a Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television. His co-star, Helena Bonham Carter, was also nominated for a Golden Globe.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After the success of Live from Baghdad, Keaton started working on a series of film projects. He played the president in the 2004 comedy First Daughter starring Katie Holmes. In 2005, he appeared in three films: the independent drama Game 6; the supernatural thriller White Noise; and the family-friendly Herbie Fully Loaded.</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">New Directions</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2006, Keaton voiced one of the characters in the popular animated film Cars.
