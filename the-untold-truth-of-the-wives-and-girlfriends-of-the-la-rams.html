Per <a href=#>Heavy</a>, her "social media accounts ... are private and [there is] little known about her beyond her relationship to her husband." What we do know: their wedding was an all-timer. While still a member of the Denver Broncos, Talib and Gypsy tied the knot in a lavish ceremony that had a guest list that included a <a href=#>who's who of the NFL stars</a> such as Von Miller,&nbsp;Chris Harris Jr., Emmanuel Sanders, Vince Wilfork, and Devin McCourty.</p><p>And it cost a pretty penny to have that much fun. "We started at $300,000, and we ended up at $320,000 or $420,000 or something crazy. Crazy, crazy,&nbsp;crazy. I was mad at the wedding planners," Talib told ESPN's His & Hers (via <a href=#>Complex</a>). "But when I walked in and I seen that reception room, I just had to say, "I ain't mad no more.' ... Money well spent.'</p><p>Aqib regularly posts about Gypsy and their three kids on his <a href=#>Instagram</a>, and if he wins another Super Bowl, be prepared for him to shout her out like he did after the Broncos defeated the Carolina Panthers in 2016. "Aqib Talib is at the podium," reporter Jeff Howe <a href=#>tweeted</a> after the game. "Mid-question, looks at his wife, 'You're looking gorgeous, baby. We're gonna get it in tonight.'" That's true love right there.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxkaH11e9OhnGatnqm8rbCMramurJhivKd506GcZq%2BZq7K0ecCnm2afmae5p77InqWdq12ks27Ax55kpZldp66uv44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
