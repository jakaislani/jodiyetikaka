The seeds of doubt were definitively sown, watered, and in full bloom.</p><p>Scrutiny mounted, pitchforks were polished, and on November 14, Rob, Fab, and manager Frank Farian conceded it had all been a ruse, according to the<a href=#>&nbsp;New York Times</a>. They were stripped of their Grammy a few days later. Rob and Fab wanted to give the award to the real singers, and claimed they'd been duped by Farian. Poor, hungry, and eager to prove themselves when the producer first encountered them in Berlin, apparently he promised them they could use their own voices on future albums and tours if they kept those lips syncing dutifully for a while. They went along with it, but he went back on his word. They also said their record label, Arista, knew about it the whole time, a claim Arista vehemently denied.</p><p>As far as most were concerned, Milli Vanilli was done. But for anyone who was still listening, a surprisingly complex and engaging story of two naive but sympathetic wannabe <a href=#>stars</a> and the mildly Machiavellian producer pulling their strings was just starting to emerge.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9kWtwbWtfrLWiwMSvnKtlmJa9sbHNnptmpZmhuap51ZqloqScnnw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
