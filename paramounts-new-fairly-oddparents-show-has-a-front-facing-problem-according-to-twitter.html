Recommended Videos Shows like iCarly, Rugrats, and now the Fairly OddParents have returned in a new form on Paramount’s streaming service, Paramount Plus. Each of the shows, which typically feature new art styles and fresh, aged-up cast members, is being met with mixed reviews from viewers online. While many millennials are delighted to see the entertainment of their youth return, most of the shows are plagued by issues that are immensely apparent to an adult audience."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Each of the shows, which typically feature new art styles and fresh, aged-up cast members, is being met with mixed reviews from viewers online. While many millennials are delighted to see the entertainment of their youth return, most of the shows are plagued by issues that are immensely apparent to an adult audience.</p><p data-characters=630 data-current-count=630 data-injectable=true>For iCarly, it’s mostly the vibe. While the fresh show does a reasonably good job of carrying a similar energy to the original, it is impossible to ignore the characters’ new aged-up appeal. Those same goofy stunts and snarky one-liners just don’t hit the same when they’re coming from a 30-year-old, as opposed to a sassy teen. In the case of The Fairly Odd Parents, most people seem to be pointing to the art style as the show’s biggest issue. This problem, which may simply require viewers to adapt, is particularly upsetting when it comes to the presentation of the fairy-obsessed Denzel Crocker.</p><p data-characters=438 data-current-count=438 data-injectable=true>Twitter is absolutely flabbergasted by Paramount Plus’ decision to present Crocker from a front-facing view, an angle never attempted in the original Fairly OddParents run. Almost all of the characters in the original series were drawn from side angles, which allowed their odd but charming artistic appeal to properly connect with audiences. The strange new angle is giving people the creeps, and leading to plenty of jokes online.</p><p data-characters=332 data-current-count=332 data-injectable=false>People swarmed to Twitter in the hours and days after season one of The Fairly OddParents: Fairly Odder debuted on Paramount Plus on March 30. Responses almost universally reviled the new, front-facing Crocker, and dragged the character for his weird new YouTuber vibe. Some are even calling it “a crime against nature.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=632 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>It's incredible that they thought this looked good. This shit looks like a bad Youtube parody of itself</p><p>And having Crocker almost entirely in front view angles feels like a crime against nature. There's a reason like every Fairly Oddparents character has a side view perspective. <a href=#>https://t.co/a1MsPWi1LL</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/V9T9VHuRkr</a></p>— TRAFON(s Backup Account) (@RiseFallNickBck) <a href=#>April 1, 2022</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>My therapist: "Front facing Mr. Crocker isn't real, he can't hurt you"</p><p>Front facing Mr. Crocker: <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/xXmCIl8nQt</a></p>— kazemaru | cringe arc (@kazekero) <a href=#>March 31, 2022</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>The last thing I wanted to see was a front view of Crocker's face</p>— Owen (@omullins67) <a href=#>March 31, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=195 data-current-count=195 data-injectable=false>People are comparing front-facing Crocker to a number of other characters, from Dexter’s Laboratory‘s Mandark to the genuine horror that is front-facing Phineas from Phineas and Ferb.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=495 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Front facing Crocker looks like an edgy Mandark <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/7gIvfNPFq0</a></p>— Mat Lippiello (@LimeTH) <a href=#>March 31, 2022</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Ok y'all pick your poison, which is more cursed, Front facing Crocker or Phineas? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/KhHLTmU9kb</a></p>— Fireheart Roo (@Chaosqueen97) <a href=#>March 31, 2022</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>This image of Crocker and clarence have the same type of energy <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/YAdpW48y5J</a></p>— Sadame “His Royal Nemesis ” (@SodameXultra) <a href=#>April 1, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=210 data-current-count=210 data-injectable=false>The shocking presentation of Crocker quickly inspired Twitter’s most creative users to summon new takes on the character, who some believe would “go hard” as the world’s next big VTuber.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=510 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>What have I fucking done. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/JOziub6R6W</a></p>— meldoe (@M3LRO2) <a href=#>April 1, 2022</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Ayo new Crocker VTuber just dropped?

There’s also the weird decision to meld live-action with animation — this almost never works, people, please stop trying — and to scatter bland musical numbers throughout.</p><p data-characters=289 data-current-count=289 data-injectable=false>The inclusion of front-facing Crocker may actually work out for the team at Paramount Plus, however. The horrific visage of the decades-old character is going so viral it will very likely pull in new viewers — even if they’re only tuning in to see the ghastly sight for themselves.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yxrdGapKitnqnAbrrEsGSfmZmnubp5zp2bqZmimru1v4ysn6ivXZ2utHnAZp2rp56peqetwqKloGWgp7yjuMSmZJqbk6S%2FpbXNoGStp12pxKrA056paA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
