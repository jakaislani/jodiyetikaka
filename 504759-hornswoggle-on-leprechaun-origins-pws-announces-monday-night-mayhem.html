I don’t know. For film, I think it’s harder because you’re not getting that instant gratification that you would in WWE."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Punch a guy in the face in WWE, people are going to cheer. Here, you punch a guy in the face, eight seconds later, “Cut, all right, let’s go again.” Okay, was that good? Was that bad? What do I need to change? You don’t know if it was good, so it’s very different. I think filmmaking is a lot harder than WWE at times.</p><p><b>How involved was the makeup for <i>Leprechaun: Origins</i>?</b></p><p>Two and a half hours twice a day. Two and a half hours in, hour to get out, lunch. Two and a half hours in, hour out. By day three I was cussing, just sick of it. I don’t know why I was having a bad day. I was just having a bad day. I was so mad at everything, but now seeing the final product, I would’ve sat there for five hours. It is so good. The creature turned out so awesome, the prosthetics and the makeup. It was amazing.</p><p>Leprechaun: Origins opens in limited theater release today, and comes to digital and video-on-demand services beginning August 26th.</p><h2>PWS Starts ‘Mayhem’</h2><p><a href=#>Pro Wrestling Syndicate</a> announces “Monday Night Mayhem” is coming to the airwaves. ‘Mayhem’ is PWS’ brand new weekly internet show, which premieres on Monday, August 25th.</p><p>New episodes will be released weekly on Monday at 11pm.
