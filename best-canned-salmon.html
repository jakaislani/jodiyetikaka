It tastes like salmon. Buttery, rich, silky, mild salmon. Unfortunately, many brands didn’t get that memo. There’s far too much canned salmon out there that is practically indistinguishable from mediocre canned tuna. But there’s a lot of good stuff out there. So, which canned salmon is best? Lucky for you, we stank up the office to find the best canned salmon brands out there.&nbsp;</p><p>Between our original taste test and a recent update, we tasted over 30 different cans of salmon and salmon pouches. Each test opened our eyes to new, deliciously buttery, decadent canned salmon—seriously, if you haven’t tried any of the brands on this list, you don’t know what you’re missing. Canned salmon is often forgotten. It’s not as utilitarian as canned tuna and not as “cool” as <a href=#>canned smoked trout</a> or <a href=#>canned sardines</a>. But it’s actually a bit of a chameleon. If you buy the best canned salmon or pouch of salmon, you’ll be ready to whip together a fish board or a simple salmon salad sandwich or salmon cakes or salmon caesar salad.&nbsp;</p><p>Canned salmon comes in a variety of preparations: in chunks, smoked, skin-on and bone-in, and in full poached filets. They all play different roles, but mostly what we looked for was a combo of taste and utility. We wanted good quality salmon—nothing suspiciously fishy. We wanted flaky salmon with a sweet, buttery flavor. And we wanted practicality. Does the salmon go well with a cracker, on a salad, and in a sandwich? The more uses, the higher it ranked. That said, in our most recent taste test, we also looked for the best canned salmon for a canned fish board and the best everyday pouch of salmon. So, here’s our updated list of the best canned salmon you can buy.</p><p class=has-small-font-size>The following article contains affiliate links that may generate a small commission to us when you make a purchase through the link.

Like a paté, it’s soft and also really dense with flavor. It’s got a great buttery taste with just a touch of sweetness. Editor-in-chief <a href=#>Justine Sterling</a> made a great suggestion, which is to add some lemon zest or juice to it. Pick some of your favorite ingredients, grab a <a href=#>box of saltines</a>, and roll with it. Just open up this can of salmon and you’ve got a ready-to-eat hors d’oeuvre. — Danny Palumbo</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Sarah Demonteverde/Amazon</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#ec7971></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="St. Jean’s Wild Skinless Boneless Sockeye Salmon" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/RANKING-UPDATE_CANNED-SALMON_INSET-09.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best for a Sandwich</p><strong>St. Jean’s Wild Skinless Boneless Sockeye Salmon</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Stjeans.com</a><p>This is a really good, hand-packed can of salmon. Inside you’ll find fatty, flaky sockeye salmon that’s been cooked in its own juices, then seasoned with some sea salt. Simplicity wins here and makes this some of the best canned sockeye salmon you can buy. It doesn’t come with any additional water or oil, so you just get a really tasty, fresh piece of fish. I love it. The salmon doesn’t have a lot of moisture and there’s no bones, so you could open up this can and put the fish directly on some bread, no problem. — Danny Palumbo</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Sarah Demonteverde/St. Jean’s</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#ec857e></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Signature Select Alaska Pink Salmon" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/RANKING-UPDATE_CANNED-SALMON_INSET-08.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best for Salmon Salad</p><strong>Signature Select Alaska Pink Salmon</strong><p>“It’s really salty, which I like,” said my colleague Jordan Myrick. Signature Select offers a fairly standard canned salmon, but it tastes good and there’s a lot of it—substantially more fish than the other products. This is a big ol’ can of salmon, so I think it’s the best canned salmon for a big batch of salmon salad. Add some <a href=#>mayonnaise</a>, a little <a href=#>vinegar</a>, some fresh herbs, and some onion.

It’s tender and it really tastes like salmon (without being too fishy). It’s rich and oily and seasoned perfectly with salt. Keep a few of these salmon pouches around to add some quick, tasty protein to a salad or whip into salmon burgers for dinner. — Justine Sterling</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#e6756e></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Henry & Lisa’s Wild Alaskan Pink Salmon " src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/RANKING-UPDATE_CANNED-SALMON_INSET-01.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"><strong>Best for a Salad Nicoise</strong></p><strong>Henry & Lisa’s Wild Alaskan Pink Salmon</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a><p>This 100% sustainable canned salmon is tender and salty and savory. You get a huge hunk of salmon in every can—complete with skin and bones. That might freak out some folks, but, personally, I like knowing that my canned salmon came from an actual fish with skin and bones rather than something created in a lab. It also tells me this isn’t a super processed canned salmon.

Deming’s can of salmon features a rolled-up fillet of salmon that’s really briny and decadent. Some of our tasters thought that it might be too salty, but to me there’s no such thing. It comes in some water, and might be a little too wet to put on a salad or a sandwich, but the flavor is too good for this to not make it into the top five best canned salmon brands. Personally, I would drink the salmon juice that comes in the can. Overall, really great stuff. The best canned sockeye salmon if you like it briny like the sea. — Danny Palumbo</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Sarah Demonteverde/Amazon</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#e4705f></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Fishwife Smoked Salmon with Fly by Jing Sichuan Chili Crisp" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/RANKING-UPDATE_CANNED-SALMON_INSET-02.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"><strong>Best for a Board</strong></p><strong>Fishwife Smoked Salmon with Fly by Jing Sichuan Chili Crisp</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Fishwife</a><p>It’s smoky.

It’s big on flavor. This wild sockeye salmon is lightly brined and smoked, so the taste is really fresh and unctuous. This tasty fillet would be great on a sandwich, in a salad, or eaten on-the-go right from the pouch. Ditch the Kind bar and bring a few Patagonia salmon pouches on your next jaunt through the mountains. — Danny Palumbo</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Sarah Demonteverde/Amazon</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#ee6e63></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Taku Smoked Sockeye Salmon" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/RANKING-UPDATE_CANNED-SALMON_INSET-04.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best of The Best</p><strong>Taku Smoked Sockeye Salmon</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Takustore.com</a><p>“This is very flaky and very good,” said Jordan of this canned smoked salmon. “I would put this on a toasted <a href=#>bagel</a> with <a href=#>cream cheese</a> and thinly sliced onion.” Sockeye salmon is a bit more oily than Atlantic salmon, so it’s got a nice, rich flavor that is enhanced when it’s smoked. This is fancy canned salmon. You have to order it from the producer, but the price isn’t too outrageous and the flavor is tough to beat. It truly is the best canned sockeye salmon you can get. It’s deliciously salty, smoky, and fatty. In addition to a bagel, I think this would go great on a Niçoise salad with some potatoes, capers, and onion. — Danny Palumbo</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Sarah Demonteverde/Taku</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>10/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#e36d5f></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Polar Salmon Fillets" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/RANKING-UPDATE_CANNED-SALMON_INSET-05.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Salmon Fillet</p><strong>Polar Salmon Fillets</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a><p>This canned salmon is so good it made me want to scream with giddy excitement. It’s a fillet of salmon in a can, but the real kicker is that it’s just so damn buttery. The salmon is intensely flavored, as is the brine in the can. There’s a real fat-forward taste, which I’m guessing is from the salmon being poached in its own fat and juices. This is the best canned salmon to serve with crackers or throw on top of some <a href=#>white rice</a> for a quick and easy meal. Honestly, none of us could believe how good it is. It tastes like it’s been poached in butter.
