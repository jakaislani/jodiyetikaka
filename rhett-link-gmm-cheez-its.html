So, without further fondue, let’s cut to this four-cheese extravaganza.</p><p class=has-small-font-size>The following article contains affiliate links that may generate a small commission to us when you make a purchase through the link.

Once R&L ate these, it was hard to go back to the plain ones, which Rhett likened to moving on from one significant other to a better one, then trying to go back to the first one when you break up with the second one. In other words, you realize they’re just not as good. Link even said he’d “never felt more confident about a Gut Check.” This flavor is just that good. The Sporked crew <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">loved this Cheez-It the most</a>, too.</p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">White Cheddar</a></strong><p>Both guys also agreed that White Cheddar Cheez-Its, much like Cheddar Jack Cheez-Its, are superior to the original because they have that good, cheesy nuance (aka powdered flavor dust). Link said “Ooooh yeah!” upon trying these, and Rhett agreed they might be a little bit better than the Original. Just a littttle bit, but definitely better.</p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Original Cheez-It</a></strong><p>Rhett said that when he eats Cheez-Its, he usually gets two in his mouth at a time because he likes the feeling of them crushing against each other. Link tried out this method and agreed it’s the best way to Cheez-It. They both thought these were super solid, and Rhett liked the “yeasty quality” these ones have. Link didn’t quite taste that yeastiness, but either way, they both liked these.</p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Extra Big</a></strong><p>How big are Extra Big Cheez-Its? Twice as big as the Original? Four times? Maybe 693,286,091 times? Nope, they’re like 1.5 times the size of normal Cheez-Its—but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. According to my calculations, that’s still more Cheez-It per Cheez-It than the average Cheez-It, so it’s still a win! Rhett said these “stink of marketing,” and that may be true, but they also stink of cheese. They are Cheez-Its, after all. However, when you try to stack two of these like Rhett does with the Original variety, it’s too much for one mouth, which definitely counted against them. The flavor is the same for the most part, although Link thought they were not as light and flaky as regular ol’ Cheez-Its. Also, and perhaps most significantly, Link noted that these have “five buttholes” on them instead of the standard one butthole that we know and love. Really, these are the same as Original, just extra big.</p><p><strong>Honorable mentions: </strong>Rhett liked the Hot and Spicy flavor due to its nice jalapeño notes. Rhett liked the Extra Toasty flavor and said it was pleasantly crispy, but Link hated it and said it tasted burnt. To eacheez own, I guess!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><a href=# class="lazy-load-youtube preview-lazyload preview-youtube" data-video-title="We Tried EVERY Cheez-It Flavor" title='Play video "We Tried EVERY Cheez-It Flavor"' rel=noopener>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWd6_Eoey_U</a></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaKqYmsG1ecuipaRll6K6bq%2FHnpyzZZmpwHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
