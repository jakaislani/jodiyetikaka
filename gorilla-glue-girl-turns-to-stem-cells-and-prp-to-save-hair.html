Louisiana’s Tessica Brown, who went viral earlier this year for using Gorilla Glue as hairspray, has undergone stem cell therapy to revive her hair after a disastrous dye job caused it to fall out. “I’m just praying that it works,” the greater New Orleans-area native told The Post of the procedure, which went down Wednesday at the La Fue Hair Clinic in Pasadena, Calif."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He added that the therapy’s growth-accelerating benefits should take effect in around six to nine months.</p><p>“Nothing that’s gonna happen overnight, but the shedding should stop real soon,” a hopeful Brown told The Post.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Hair expert Jacques Abrahamian oversaw the procedure. <span class=credit>MEGA</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">It took two sets of hands to perform the work on Brown’s scalp. <span class=credit>MEGA</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">A closeup of the injection site shows where Brown’s hair had been thinned the most. <span class=credit>MEGA</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large is-resized">The treatment of this fountain of youth could cost around $6,000. <span class=credit>MEGA</span></figure><p>The only downside is that “Gorilla Glue girl” will have to wait several months before dyeing her hair again. When the time comes, Abrahamian recommends an “organic hair dye” without paraphenylenediamine, a chemical widely used in conventional hair dyes, which he said caused Brown’s initial allergic reaction.</p><p>Brown, for one, is not going to roll the dye when it comes to hair colorants. “I think I’m just going to stick with that,” she said. “At this point, I’m just scared.”</p><p>It’s been a long road for Brown, who spawned nationwide facepalms after styling her with Gorilla Glue and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sharing her hardship</a> on social media in February. She had resorted to the ill-advised sculpting method as she was late for a date and didn’t have any traditional hair adhesive.</p><p>Go figure: The Gorilla Glue wouldn’t come out of her hair no matter how much she washed it and she feared that she was going to lose it entirely.
