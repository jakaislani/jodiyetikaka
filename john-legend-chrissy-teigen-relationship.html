But this one had a tint of sadness behind it.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Just two weeks earlier, Teigen had announced on social media that she suffered the loss of their third child, a baby boy they had started calling Jack. The couple publicly mourned their child, but Teigen left a clear message at the end of her announcement on Instagram. They were going through grief like they did everything else in their 14-year romance — together.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“On this darkest of days, we will grieve, we will cry our eyes out. But we will hug and love each other harder and get through it,” Teigen wrote.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="css-a5dq20 emevuu60">Their pair met during a music video shoot</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Years before Teigen and Legend became one of Hollywood’s fan-favorite couples, they met in a setting familiar to the recording world: a music video.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Teigen and Legend were introduced on the September 2006 set of Legend’s music video for “Stereo,” in which Teigen played the object of Legend’s affection. Sparks quickly flew and Teigen recalled in a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/news/a24251/chrissy-teigen-on-june-2014-cosmo/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cosmopolitan interview" class="body-link css-9lyfaf emevuu60">Cosmopolitan interview</a> how the two ended up eating In-n-Out burgers at his hotel room after the 14-hour shoot.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I'm not going to lie. We hooked up," the typically-candid Teigen admitted, adding how the two chatted for a year over the phone as Legend went on tour.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">All the while, Teigen was biding her time to be with the superstar singer.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I let him be himself for a while," she told the magazine. "The worst thing you can do is try to lock someone like that down early on, then have them think, There's so much more out there. I played it cool for a long time.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Luckily for Teigen, the wit and charm that all her fans love is exactly what ended up making Legend fall for her.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"[At the beginning of our relationship] we were texting a lot, and I started to see her sense of humor," Legend told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.etonline.com/news/195595_exclusive_john_legend_reveals_the_moment_he_fell_love_with_chrissy_teigen data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Entertainment Tonight" class="body-link css-9lyfaf emevuu60">Entertainment Tonight</a>.

The couple wed two years later on September 14, 2013, seven years after they met and three months after starring in the steamy music video for one of Legend’s biggest hits, “All of Me.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The romantic song has become a go-to at weddings and instantly made Teigen cry when she heard it.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It’s inspired by Chrissy. She loved the song and cried when she heard it,” Legend told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/celebrity/john-legend-opens-up-about-wedding-to-chrissy-teigen/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-9lyfaf emevuu60">People</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The video was shot at Lake Como, Italy, the site where the two would have their star-studded wedding just months later. Legend serenaded his new wife with “All of Me” after they said “I do.”</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="css-a5dq20 emevuu60">The couple had trouble conceiving their children naturally</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the years following their marriage, Legend and Teigen welcomed their kids Luna in April 2016 and Miles in May 2018.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Though they now delight the internet with their adventures on Instagram, Teigen revealed her rollercoaster journey to motherhood in a segment on her talk show FABLife with co-host <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/celebrities/tyra-banks data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Tyra Banks" class="body-link css-9lyfaf emevuu60">Tyra Banks</a>. The then-model revealed she became pregnant with Luna through IVF after the couple tried to have children for years.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“John and I were having trouble. We would have had kids five, six years ago if it had happened,” she said. “But my gosh, it’s been a process.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Two years later, Teigen once again opened up about her private life, revealing her heartbreaking struggle with postpartum depression after welcoming Luna. The cookbook author wrote about the “spontaneous crying” and days on end without leaving her house in a cover story for <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.glamour.com/story/chrissy-teigen-postpartum-depression data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Glamour class="body-link css-9lyfaf emevuu60">Glamour</a> in 2017, recalling how Legend helped her through the pain.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“He’s exactly as compassionate, patient, loving, and understanding as he seems,” she wrote of Legend. “John has been incredible over the last nine months, bringing me my medicine and watching horrible reality TV with me. He is not the goofiest guy, but he has gone out of his way to indulge my sense of humor...I know he must look over at times and think: My God, get it together. But he has never made me feel that way. He wants me to be happy, silly, and energetic again, but he’s not making me feel bad when I’m not in that place.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The couple welcomed son Miles the next year, and the mini-me of his father quickly took the hearts of the family as they settled into being a foursome.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In August 2020, the family’s music video journey came full circle as the four starred in the video for Legend’s song “Wild” years after the couple brought Luna along for the 2016 music video for “Love Me Now.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“We have 'All of Me,' the marriage, no kids yet.

But just the next month, Teigen would make the heartbreaking announcement on Instagram that she had suffered a pregnancy loss after weeks of bed rest.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After his Billboard Awards performance, Legend tweeted a statement about the family’s resolve to get through the pain together.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“This is for Chrissy. I love and cherish you and our family so much. We’ve experienced the highest highs and lowest lows together.

What an awesome gift it is to be able to bring life into the world. We’ve experienced the miracle, the power and joy of this gift, and now we’ve deeply felt its inherent fragility,” he continued.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I wrote this song because I have faith that as long as we walk this earth, we will hold each other’s hands through every tear, through every up and down, through every test,” he added. “We promised each other this on our wedding day seven years ago, and every challenge we’ve faced has made that promise more powerful, more resilient. Our love will remain. We will never break.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGikrquZmLaiutJooaignmK5prPEp5tmm5intrS%2F2GarnqGXmrtuvsSlmK2hn6PAqbXP</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
