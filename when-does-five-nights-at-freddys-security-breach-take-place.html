The main timeline unfolds <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">across nine games</a>, all revolving around a singular location: Freddy Fazbear’s Pizzeria, named after its mascot, Freddy Fazbear.

Throughout the games, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the series’&nbsp;lore</a>&nbsp;is gradually revealed through voice recordings, minigames, and&nbsp;Easter eggs. As of 2023, there are countless spin-off games, a novel trilogy and anthology series, as well as an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming live-action movie</a>.</p><p data-characters=403 data-current-count=403 data-injectable=true>Five Nights at Freddy’s: Security Breach is the eighth main game in the franchise and the most recent, succeeding Five Nights at Freddy’s: Help Wanted. Likewise, the events of Security Breach occur directly after Help Wanted. This game differs from the other installments as it features only one night, not several, and even allows free-roam gameplay instead of confinement to a single room.</p><p data-characters=305 data-current-count=305 data-injectable=false>The player controls a young boy named Gregory, who must evade hostile animatronic characters and a night guard in a large shopping mall, hoping to survive until morning. In order to progress throughout Freddy Fazbear’s Mega Pizzaplex, Gregory must complete various missions to advance the gameplay.</p><p data-characters=350 data-current-count=655 data-injectable=true>Depending on which of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">six possible endings</a> one acquires, the events following lead into Ruin, the&nbsp;Five Nights at Freddy’s: Security Breach DLC expansion. In this DLC, players assume control of Cassie, Gregory’s friend, as she explores the dilapidated pizzeria with nothing more than a wrench, a walkie-talkie, and a weird bunny mask.</p><p data-characters=241 data-current-count=241 data-injectable=false>Out of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">all Ruin‘s endings</a>, the Betrayal Ending is considered to be the canon ending, which may lead to the events of a second DLC for Security Breach or the upcoming game&nbsp;Help Wanted 2, which is scheduled for release later this year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZorqGdnmKxsLHSZp2irpViu6qzx62qZpmkYrOzscOdsKxlo5qwtr7IrbBmmqKarqS0jK2YpJ1dpbmir8Ro</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
