But, like millions worldwide, everything skidded to a halt when COVID-19 hit. Cherry's career was skyrocketing before HBO abruptly paused filming during the pandemic. The actor worried her new career had irreparably ended too. "A part of me was like, 'I don't even know if this is going to happen,'" Cherry told <a href=#>The Cut</a>. "I was ready to give it my all and then was so bummed."</p><p>Eventually, the pause button was lifted, though. As the new norm dawned, Cherry quickly realized she'd been premature with her concerns. In fact, the <a href=#>truth was that Cherry's</a> career was opening up in ways she'd never even imagined before. Her significant social media presence had resulted in "Euphoria" director Sam Levinson first spotting and then casting Cherry. But now, she had become an influencer on a grand scale and it did not take long for the fashion and beauty industry to come knocking.</p><p>Cherry's modeling career went from nothing to buzzing without passing go. Per <a href=#>V Magazine</a>, Cherry became "the face" of the Versace X SSENSE SS22 ad campaign and modeled for <a href=#>Paper</a>. Before&nbsp;long, she was walking catwalks worldwide and strutting down the runway at New York Fashion Week with the likes of Kendall Jenner and Bella and Gigi Hadid. "It was incredible," Cherry told Flaunt. "It was an amazing experience. It was so cool being backstage," she continued.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhgZ4J6go6ipayhlJp6pLTLqJxmm5iav7PF0makqJyVobavs4ycmKudlad8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
