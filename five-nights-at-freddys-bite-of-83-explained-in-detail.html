In order to unlock the Bite of ’83 flashback/minigame, the player must successfully complete Night 5.</p><h2 id=h-what-is-the-bite-of-83-in-five-nights-at-freddy-s data-injectable=false>What is the Bite of ’83 in Five Nights at Freddy’s?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bite-of-83-fnaf.png><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=396 data-injectable=false>Completing Night 5 will trigger the pixelated reenactment of the Bite of ’83, wherein Fredbear, the earliest iteration of Freddy Fazbear, and who resides at Fredbear’s Family Diner, kills Evan Afton/The Crying Child. During the scene, a group of youngsters — including his own older brother — tease Evan for being afraid of the animatronics, so they force him closer to Fredbear.</p><p data-characters=448 data-current-count=844 data-injectable=true>Michael, Afton’s brother, says that Evan “wants to give FredBear a big kiss,” prompting the gang to lift Evan up and place his head into Fredbear’s mouth. All of them find the whole situation wildly amusing, until Fredbear’s mouth clamps down on Evan’s head, killing him instantly. There have been numerous depictions of Evan being decapitated, although it’s possible that Fredbear merely snapped his neck.</p><p data-characters=377 data-current-count=377 data-injectable=false>At the end of Night 6, the player sees Evan once more, this time surrounded by plushies of the original animatronics — including Fredbear, who delivers the following dialogue to The Crying Child: “You’re broken. We are still your friends. Do you still believe that? I’m still here. I will put you back together.” After this, both Fredbear and Evan vanish.</p><h2 id=h-what-is-the-meaning-behind-the-bite-of-83 data-injectable=false>What is the meaning behind the Bite of ’83?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/five-nights-at-freddys-bite-of-83.png><p data-characters=482 data-current-count=482 data-injectable=true>Additionally, it is heavily implied that The Crying Child is the son of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">William Afton</a>. It should be noted that “Evan’ is the unconfirmed first name of The Crying Child, but we include it here for consistency purposes. In 2021, a Reddit user suggested that The Crying Child’s name might be Evan, derived from the Crying Child’s first name, it being “Evan,” using the&nbsp;Five Nights at Freddy’s: Survival Logbook. Scott Cawthon has yet to confirm this.</p><p data-characters=318 data-current-count=318 data-injectable=false>The exact events which supposedly occurred during the Bite of ’87 are more vague. We pieced together <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">an explainer</a>, but this murder is committed by an unnamed animatronic, believed to be Springtrap. It also takes place at the refurbished Freddy Fazbear’s Pizzeria, rather than Fredbear’s Family Diner.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZonaKulWK7qrPHrapmmaRis7Oxw52wrGWSnsGmec6fZHFrXZrFsbjAoqWenF2eu26wxK2YoqRf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
