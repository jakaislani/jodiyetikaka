The role of Carly was originated by Sarah Joy Brown in 1996. Now a TV veteran much like Laura Wright, Brown was only just getting into the world of acting in the mid-'90s, after attending the Los Angeles High School for the Performing Arts at California State University."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Now a TV veteran much like Laura Wright, Brown was only just getting into the world of acting in the mid-'90s, after attending the Los Angeles High School for the Performing Arts at California State University. Following a stint on the short-lived syndicated superhero show "VR Troopers," Brown found in Carly Roberts her first big breakthrough. She booked the role at the age of 21, beating out a field of seven actresses that included the real-life then-girlfriend of Steve Burton, who played Jason Morgan, according to&nbsp;<a href=#>Sarah Brown Online</a>.</p><p>Ultimately, Sarah Joy Brown's devious, unapologetically villainous take on Port Charles' pot-stirring newcomer and serial homewrecker made her one of the actresses American soap audiences most loved to hate. She won a total of three Daytime Emmys for her performance, with two of them being in the&nbsp;outstanding younger actress category, reserved for performers under 25. As the end of her contract drew near, however, Brown inched toward the decision to move on from Carly, leading ABC to seek out a replacement for her, per a report from&nbsp;<a href=#>SoapCentral.com</a>. And, in time, they managed to find one.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbvOqZyrZpOkunB9kXFsa2hhZMSpu4ypo5qxlZl6pK3RpbBmn5WjsrOty2afqKugnsGiuI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
