What sort of charmer was able to sweep someone like Maya Rudolph off her feet? This might blow a few minds, but she is married to none other than<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Paul Thomas Anderson</a>. Cinematic genius, one of our generation’s best directors—yes, it’s THAT Paul Thomas Anderson. Are you freaking out yet?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=686 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=189 data-current-count=189 data-injectable=false>He’s the guy responsible for films like Boogie Nights, Magnolia, The Master, Punch-Drunk Love, There Will Be Blood, Inherent Vice, Phantom Thread, and, more recently, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Licorice Pizza</a>.</p><p data-characters=495 data-current-count=684 data-injectable=true>He is as inventive as any filmmaker has ever been. Touching on universal themes and iconic visual styles, Anderson has always been able to astound us. More than that, he forces his audience to think for themselves, making discoveries along the way. He’s been nominated and won countless awards (never an Oscar, which should be a scandal), directed some of Hollywood’s finest actors, and continues to inspire creatives of all ages. We just have one question, how did he and Maya meet?</p><p data-characters=233 data-current-count=233 data-injectable=false>For now, the answer continues to elude us. Maya and Paul have never shared publicly how they met. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">In an interview with The Guardian,</a> when asked about their relationship, she went as far to say, “I never talk about Paul.”</p><p data-characters=346 data-current-count=579 data-injectable=true>Frankly though, that’s quite alright. If they don’t feel like sharing how they got together, more power to them. Moments like that can be personal for anyone. Whether it’s because you value privacy or are among the world’s biggest stars, we all deserve to keep that intimacy to ourselves. We’d sure like to think so.</p><p data-characters=343 data-current-count=343 data-injectable=false>At the end of the day, it’s just cool to see people find love. At a time when the entertainment industry is filled with constant breakups, relationship changes, and drama, knowing these two are out there keeping each other honest for the rest of us is all we need. It motivates us to spread a little kindness and have fun in the process.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S2tHnMmrCaZaKqsbC4z6Fkppmip7amsI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
