If a soda icon like Pepsi couldn’t pull it off, the question becomes: Is chocolate soda good?</p><p>I was not able to try Pepsi’s Cocoa Cola last year, but thankfully Rocket Fizz specializes in gourmet sodas of the chocolate persuasion, which they sell on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon</a>. After getting a bottle and giving it a try, I have to admit, I don’t think chocolate soda is for me. The initial taste is hard to pinpoint—Is it sour? Is it acidic? Is it barbecue-y?? I had so many questions that remained unanswered somehow, even after drinking nearly half the bottle. It’s the kind of taste you can’t quite put a finger on.</p><p>So you keep drinking it, hoping the answer will present itself. As Sporked social media manager Mark Catangui said after trying some, “It feels unmemorable, but the experience of trying to figure out what you’re tasting is very addicting.” The aftertaste is similar to that of a Tootsie Roll, but not in a good way. It tastes a bit like drinking carbonated water that you left some chocolate Tootsie Pops to soak in overnight (and smells like it too). I couldn’t see myself drinking this by itself or even craving it the way I do a nice cream soda.</p><p>I’m sorry to say this, but I think we can close the investigation on chocolate soda. If there is a reason why more companies aren’t manufacturing it, I’m pretty sure it’s because chocolate soda is just not very good.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>I’m giving it 2.5/10 Sporks</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaKGjYrCpu8Koo5qslWLAsLDAZp6op5Rk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
