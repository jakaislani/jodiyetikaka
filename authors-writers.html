Wiesel, who grew up with three sisters and pursued religious studies at a nearby yeshiva, was influenced by the traditional spiritual beliefs of his grandfather and mother, as well as his father's liberal expressions of Judaism.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Surviving the Holocaust</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1940, Hungary annexed Sighet and the Wiesels were among the Jewish families forced to live in ghettoes. In May 1944, Nazi Germany, with Hungary's agreement, forced Jews living in Sighet to be deported to the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in Nazi-occupied Poland. At the age of 15, Wiesel and his entire family were sent to Auschwitz as part of the Holocaust, which took the lives of more than 6 million Jews. Wiesel was sent to Buna Werke labor camp, a sub-camp of Auschwitz III-Monowitz, with his father where they were forced to work under deplorable, inhumane conditions. They were transferred to other Nazi camps and force marched to Buchenwald where his father died after being beaten by a German soldier, just three months before the camp was liberated. Wiesel’s mother and younger sister Tzipora also died in the Holocaust. Elie was freed from Buchenwald in 1945. Of his relatives, only he and his older sisters Beatrice and Hilda survived.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Night'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Wiesel went on to study at the Sorbonne in France from 1948-51 and took up journalism, writing for French and Israeli publications. His friend and colleague François Mauriac, a French Nobel Laureate for Literature, encouraged him to write about his experiences in the camps; Wiesel would publish in Yiddish the memoir And the World Would Remain Silent in 1956. The book was shortened and published in France as La Nuit, and as Night for English readers in 1960. The memoir eventually became an acclaimed bestseller, translated into many languages, and is considered a seminal work on the terrors of the Holocaust.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“Never shall I forget that night, the first night in camp, which has turned my life into one long night, seven times cursed and seven times sealed,” Mr. Wiesel wrote hauntingly of his experience. “Never shall I forget that smoke. Never shall I forget the little faces of the children, whose bodies I saw turned into wreaths of smoke beneath a silent blue sky. Never shall I forget those flames which consumed my faith forever. Never shall I forget the nocturnal silence which deprived me, for all eternity, of the desire to live. Never shall I forget those moments which murdered my God and my soul and turned my dreams to dust. Never shall I forget these things, even if I am condemned to live long as God himself. Never.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Night was followed by two novels, Dawn (1961) and Day (1962), to form a trilogy that looked closely at humankind’s destructive treatment of one another.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Writer and World Activist</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Wiesel moved to New York in 1955 and became a U.S. citizen in 1963. He met Marion Rose, an Austrian Holocaust survivor, in New York, and they married in Jerusalem in 1969.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">More Books by Wiesel</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Wiesel went on to write many books, including the novels Town of Luck (1962), The Gates of the Forest (1966) and The Oath (1973), and such nonfiction works as Souls on Fire: Portraits and Legends of Hasidic Masters (1982) and the memoir All Rivers Run to the Sea (1995). Wiesel also became a revered international activist, orator and figure of peace over the years, speaking out against injustices perpetrated in an array of countries, including South Africa, Bosnia, Cambodia and Rwanda. In 1978, Wiesel was appointed chair of the President's Commission on the Holocaust by President <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/jimmy-carter data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jimmy Carter" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jimmy Carter</a>. He was honored across the world with a number of awards, including the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom and the French Legion of Honor's Grand Croix.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Teaching was another of Wiesel's passions, and he was appointed in the mid-1970s as Boston University's Andrew W. Mellon Professor in the Humanities. He also taught Judaic studies at the City University of New York, and served as a visiting scholar at Yale.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Wiesel won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986. The Nobel citation honoring him stated: “Wiesel is a messenger to mankind. His message is one of peace, atonement and human dignity. His belief that the forces fighting evil in the world can be victorious is a hard-won belief.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He founded the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.eliewieselfoundation.org/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity</a> with his wife Marion to "combat indifference, intolerance and injustice" throughout the world.
