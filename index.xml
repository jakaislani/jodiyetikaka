One is a viewing mode designed specifically for reading, which is pretty similar in theory to Reader mode in Safari, with text reflowing in columns to fit the display and all navigation and editing tools being hidden to present the document in a consumption-centric manner. The other is much better handling of PDFs - Word 2013 can now open PDFs and treat most content (text, tablets, formatting) exactly the same as standard Word docs.</description></item><item><title>Bradford Cover Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</title><link>/bradford-cover.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/bradford-cover.html</guid><description>Height, Weight &amp;amp; Physical Stats Body Measurements 40-12-34 inches Bodytype Fit Height 5 feet 8 inches (1.73 m) Weight 66 kg (145 lbs) Hair Color Brown Eye Color Brown Nickname Cover Gender Male Age 57 years old (in 2024) Date of Birth January 26, 1967 Full Name Bradford Cover Profession Actor Nationality American Birthplace New York, USA Religion Christianity Zodiac Sign Aquarius Gallery Bradford Cover Career Profession: Actor</description></item><item><title>What is the difference between Sweetsop and soursop?</title><link>/what-is-the-difference-between-sweetsop-and-soursop-html.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/what-is-the-difference-between-sweetsop-and-soursop-html.html</guid><description>Answer

The movie packs too much plot into 114 minutes and&amp;nbsp;has serious pacing issues, and&amp;nbsp;because its makers don't have a eye for spectacular set pieces, it&amp;nbsp;never looks as grand as it should.
