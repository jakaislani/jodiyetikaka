Read on and get the answers to all of your questions, opa!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-greek-dressing><strong>What is Greek dressing?</strong></h2><p>Greek salad dressing is a zesty vinaigrette style salad dressing made with Greek flavors. In the U.S. and other countries, Greek dressing is typically the common dressing that accompanies a Greek salad. While it’s usually a vinaigrette, there are some creamy versions out there as well. Most of the major salad dressing brands, from Kraft to Newman’s Own, have a Greek dressing in their lineup. But it’s also incredibly easy to make at home.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-s-in-greek-dressing><strong>What’s in Greek dressing?</strong></h2><p>So, how do you make Greek dressing? Very carefully! Sorry, that was a bad joke. I think the Greek dressing that I’ve been chugging has some alcohol in it. The basic Greek salad ingredient list includes two tablespoons of red wine vinegar, one tablespoon of <a href=#>Dijon mustard</a>, half a teaspoon of dried oregano, a fourth of a cup of <a href=#>olive oil</a>, some minced garlic, half a teaspoon of salt, and pepper to taste. Some recipes add fresh lemon juice, or even swap out the red wine vinegar for lemon. Some add parsley, sugar, onion powder, and more. You can make creamy Greek dressing with those ingredients as a base and then add some yogurt, honey, and <a href=#>feta cheese</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-is-greek-dressing-vegan-does-greek-dressing-have-dairy>I<strong>s Greek dressing vegan? Does Greek dressing have dairy?</strong></h2><p>While the homemade stuff is most often vegan (unless you go the creamy route), a lot of store brands of Greek dressing are not vegan. Many brands (like Newman’s Own and Hellman’s) include feta or at least some cheese cultures, which means that those brands of Greek dressing contain dairy. But there are some vegan and dairy-free options out there, just read those labels.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-is-greek-dressing-gluten-free><strong>Is Greek dressing gluten free?</strong></h2><p>Homemade Greek dressing is gluten free—unless someone is grinding up breadcrumbs nearby. And many brands advertise their Greek dressing as being gluten free. Just be sure to check the label if you’re very sensitive to gluten.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-does-greek-dressing-taste-like><strong>What does Greek dressing taste like?</strong></h2><p>Greek dressing tastes bright and bold; some have compared it to a cross between Caesar and Italian dressings.&nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to salad dressing, it’s all Greek to me. Just kidding—only Greek salad dressing is Greek to me. Now, let’s smash some plates and eat some salad!&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaK%2BYlsFutdJmnqudlaB6pb7ErKqippdk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
