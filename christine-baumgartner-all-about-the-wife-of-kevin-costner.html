At the time, the former was married to Cindy Costner, and Baumgartner was a professional model. After meeting at a restaurant in 1999, they struck up a romantic relationship. Costner was open to finding love with Baumgartner after his divorce from Cindy, and they dated for four years. However, the couple called it quits in 2003 and temporarily separated because they couldn’t agree on whether or not to have children. Baumgartner wanted children, but Costner was pleased with his former marriage’s three children. He is also the father of ex-girlfriend Bridget Rooney’s kid Liam Costner.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Kevin-Costner-3.jpg alt="Kevin Costner" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The breakup was short-lived, and the Wyatt Earp actor revealed how he found his way back to Baumgartner. In an interview with Closer Weekly in 2018, he stated:</p><p>“I didn’t marry Christine because I was afraid. [She] desired a kid, but I was concerned that I would be ineffective as a parent.”</p><p>On September 25, 2004, the pair married at Kevin’s property in Aspen, Colorado. They have three children: two boys, Cayden and Hayes, and a girl, Grace.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiaoaqZqMGqusRmmZqtnZyus8DNnqlmmZyheqKuzq6rZqyYmnq4tcWeZKieXaCyt7XNZpqoq6SjsrN7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
