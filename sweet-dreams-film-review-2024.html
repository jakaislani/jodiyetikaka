The movie is shot in the squarish, 4x3 "Academy"&nbsp;ratio, mostly through wide-angle lenses that cartoonishly distort people and objects (especially when the camera shifts position quickly). Almost every establishing shot is symmetrically framed, not in the manner of a&nbsp;<a href=#>Stanley Kubrick</a> or <a href=#>Wes Anderson</a>, but fetishistic fan art inspired by them. Objects and people&nbsp;within each shot are arranged like elements in a glassed-in art installation. The movie is a zoo with people in it. The movie observes its characters with coldly analytical, often withering precision, up to a point.&nbsp;</p><p>Then it all finally gives way to something more overtly lyrical and even dreamlike. The film seems to lose interest in satire and slapstick and takes more detours to present a startling, odd, often beautiful image or situation (often one involving the elemental forces:&nbsp;water, fire, wind, and soil). The story doesn't so much end as stop, but only after delivering&nbsp;a series of moments and set pieces that are shot and edited (in one case, cross-cut)&nbsp;with a mysterious yet unexplained&nbsp;deliberateness that is&nbsp;a hallmark of expressionistic modern art.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the flights of fancy in the final twenty minutes are so beautiful that they retroactively make the earlier parts of the film seem like an overbearing&nbsp;warmup to what's truly special and memorable about the project. There's a very long take near the end that's as surprising and excessive-yet-perfect as one in <a href=#>David Lynch</a> and Mark Frost's "Twin&nbsp;Peaks:&nbsp;The Return" where a man mops an entire&nbsp;bar floor while Booker T. and the MGs' "Green&nbsp;Onion" plays out at full length.&nbsp;It could be that this is a filmmaker who becomes more vital and unique the more deeply she plugs into her subconscious and the more completely she&nbsp;surrenders to it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46srp6dpGKxs7HApqpmnpmhum6%2BxK%2Bgnq9dZ31zgA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
