She is best known for portraying the character of Happy Quinn, a genius mechanical-engineer, on the CBS television series, Scorpion. Currently, Jadyn is believed to be unmarried.</strong></p><p>Budding actors the world over want to eventually become global brands. They understand that it takes time to go from participating in a thousand auditions every year to having your name on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. And many of them are willing to buckle down and bide their time.</p><p>Jadyn Wong’s story is similar, except that in her case, she started working with names like Robert Duvall from her very first project. The Canadian actress is known mostly for her role as Happy Quinn in CBS’s successful series, Scorpion.&nbsp;</p><p>Before this, Jadyn made guest appearances in series like Caprica (2010), Being Erica&nbsp;(2011), and Working the Engels&nbsp;(2014). As for her film involvements, Wong was part of the cast for projects like Space Buddies&nbsp;(2009),&nbsp;Cosmopolis&nbsp;(2012), and the Canadian sci-fi horror film,&nbsp;Debug&nbsp;(2014).</p><h3><strong>Summary of Jadyn Wong’s Biography</strong></h3><table id=tablepress-1147 class="tablepress tablepress-id-1147"><tr class="row-1 odd"><th class=column-1><strong>Age/Date of Birth:</strong><br></th><th class=column-2>38 years old (11th of May, 1985)</th></tr><tbody class=row-hover><tr class="row-2 even"><td class=column-1><strong>Height:</strong><br></td><td class=column-2>5ft 3 ¼ (160.7 cm)</td></tr><tr class="row-3 odd"><td class=column-1><strong>Ethnicity/Race:</strong><br></td><td class=column-2>Asian-Canadian</td></tr><tr class="row-4 even"><td class=column-1><strong>Nationality:</strong></td><td class=column-2>Canadian</td></tr><tr class="row-5 odd"><td class=column-1><strong>Husband or Boyfriend:</strong></td><td class=column-2>N/A</td></tr><tr class="row-6 even"><td class=column-1><strong>Parents:</strong></td><td class=column-2>N/A</td></tr></tbody><tr class="row-7 odd"><th class=column-1><strong>Net Worth:</strong></th><th class=column-2>$1 million</th></tr></table><h3><strong>Who is <span class=JsGRdQ>Jadyn Wong?</span></strong></h3><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/Jadyn_Wong.jpg alt=Jadyn_Wong width=800 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><strong>Who Is Jadyn Wong?</strong></h2><p>Wong was named Kristianna Jesse Wong after she was born on the 11th of May 1989 in Medicine Hat, located in Alberta, Canada. Her parents migrated from Hong Kong and would later run a restaurant for livelihood.</p><p>The fact that Jadyn Wong was born in Canada didn’t rob her of her Chinese heritage. As a child, the actress took to karate as a hobby, eventually earning herself a black belt for her efforts. Interestingly, Jadyn’s foray into acting while in junior high had nothing to do with having a passion for the craft: it was simply a means for her to get over always being shy.</p><p>While schooling at Medicine Hat High School, Wong enrolled in the drama class and this marked the beginning of her journey as an actress. By the time she was studying commerce at the University of Calgary’s Haskayne School of Business, she was already signed to a local talent agency and was constantly meandering her way into auditions for the school’s theatre department.</p><p>She would later audition for a role in the Emmy award-winning mini-series, Broken Trail (2006). Out of the hundreds of girls that auditioned for the role, Wong was hand-picked by Robert Duvall. She subsequently deferred school to focus on a career in acting. The actress would later get her degree in Commerce from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.</p><h3><b>How Her Career Progressed Over The Years</b></h3><p>After&nbsp;Broken Trail, Jadyn Wong’s career did not immediately take off as she hoped. In fact, there was a waiting period of sorts: almost a decade in which Jadyn’s career was confined to B-level films and guest appearances on a few series.</p><p>In 2010, she played a 2-episode role in Caprica and followed that up the following year with appearances in an episode of Rookie Blue&nbsp;and 6 episodes of&nbsp;Being Erica.&nbsp;</p><p>While her career in television was trudging along, Jadyn made her film debut in 2009 as a Chinese reporter in the family comedy, Space Buddies.&nbsp;A few other movies followed in the American, Canadian, and even the Mexican movie industry.</p><p>Her patience and perseverance were finally rewarded when she scored her breakthrough role, playing Happy Quinn on CBS’s action drama, Scorpion. She played Quinn for a total of four seasons, culminating in 2018.</p><p>In the series, Quinn is a badass and genius-level mechanical engineer who assembles an international team of other geniuses to protect the world from itself. Weirdly enough, the original script of the series was supposed to portray Wong’s character as a man. But it was rewritten to allow the actress to join the cast.</p><p>Jadyn was joined on set by the likes of Elyes Gabel who plays Walter O’Brien, Katharine McPhee who plays Paige Dineen, and Eddie Kaye Thomas who plays Toby Curtis.</p><h2><strong>Is Jadyn Wong Married or Dating Anyone?</strong></h2><p>In recent years, Jadyn Wong’s love life has been a big topic of discussion for her fans. This was triggered by the scene in Scorpion where Toby Curtis (Eddie Kaye Thomas) knelt down and popped the question to Quinn.</p><p>Happy rejected his proposal, stating that she was already married, later revealing her husband as Walter O’Brien (Elyes Gabel). In the series, she also revealed to Toby that she was pregnant for him, although it later turned out to be false.</p><p>With that, it was widely speculated that Quinn’s marriage and pregnancy were a nod to the status of Wong’s love life in the real world. The actress was essentially rumored to be dating either Gabel or Eddie Kaye.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/Jadyn_Wong.jpg><p>The rumors got louder after the actress started making social media posts that frequently referenced babysitting. Wong later explained that she was referring to babysitting her friend’s pets. Nonetheless, some fans still feel that the actress is hiding something.</p><p>Whether that is the case or not, the actress has not fessed up anything. She has not had a paparazzi incident either, where she was caught in an outing with any man. She is either not in a relationship or has guru-level strategies for keeping her private life away from the public eye.</p><h2><strong>FAQs&nbsp;</strong></h2><h3><strong>What is Jadyn Wong’s Age?</strong></h3><p>Jadyn Wong is 34 years old.
