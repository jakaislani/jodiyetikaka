However, things took an unexpected turn <a href=#>as he suffered devasting injury and has ruled out any possibility</a> to appear at the upcoming Royal Rumble event, even after months of rehabilitation.</p><p>The 36-year-old superstar signed with WWE back in 2009 and was recognized for his talent during his run in WWE NXT around 2012-2013. Big E’s hard work and in-ring skill led him to become the NXT champion and soon after, he was called up to the main roster.</p><p>Big E made his main roster debut in 2012, aligning himself with Dolph Ziggler and AJ Lee. After a lackluster run as a singles star, Big E found immense success as a part of The New Day alongside Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods. <a href=#>The trio went on to become one of the most accomplished and popular factions</a> in the history of the company.</p><p>After the WWE draft split up The New Day, Big E went on to achieve the big dream by winning the WWE championship for the first time in his career in September 2021. His connection with the audience <a href=#>even as singles competitor at the time </a>indicated a huge push for the talented star.</p><p>However, Big E has been out of action due to a severe neck injury he suffered on the March 11th, 2022 episode of SmackDown. He revealed that his return would happen sometime after March during an interview with&nbsp;<a href=#>These Urban Times</a>.</p><p>“I have to get some more scans at the one-year mark in March, and then we’ll see how everything’s looking, but we’ll see from there… I was very fortunate, so I just want to make sure I’m making the best decision for myself, so we’ll see in March.”</p><p>This rules out any speculation that Big E will return as a surprise entrant in the upcoming Royal Rumble match. He is really injured, and still waiting for a check-up in March. We’re hoping he gets good news when that doctor appointment rolls around.</p><p>Big E is currently back home in Tampa to finish his recovery process, and his chances of making it to WrestleMania also look bleak. We hope to see Big E recover from this serious injury and be back in the ring soon. In the meantime, keep checking back with <a href=#>Ringside News</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p><strong>Do you think Big E would be back inside the squared circle soon?
