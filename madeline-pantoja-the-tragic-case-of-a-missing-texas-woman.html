She had a bright smile and a loving family and friends. She also had a dog named Luna, who was her loyal companion. But on May 10, 2023, Madeline’s life was cut short by a brutal act of violence. Her disappearance and death sparked a massive search and investigation that led to the arrest of a suspect, Mario Juan Chacon Jr., who is accused of murdering her and dumping her body in a rural area.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The Disappearance</h3><p>On May 10, Madeline had dinner with a friend, who dropped her off at her apartment at the Palladium Museum Place Apartments around 9 p.m. She never made it inside her home. Her phone and car keys were left behind, along with Luna, who was waiting for her owner to return.</p><p>Madeline’s friends and family became worried when they could not reach her the next day. They contacted the apartment manager, who let them into her home. They noticed that the door was slightly cracked open and that there was a mop and a bucket of dirty water near the entrance. The floor was sticky with cleaning products. There was also a missing comforter on the bed and a dark red stain on the sheet.</p><p>Madeline’s brother called Mario Juan Chacon Jr., who was Madeline’s boyfriend and lived with her occasionally. Chacon claimed that he had been with his father all day and did not know where Madeline was. He showed no concern for her whereabouts.</p><p>Madeline’s brother reported her missing to the Midland Police Department on May 11. The police suspected foul play and launched an investigation.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The Search</h3><p>The search for Madeline involved multiple law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, the Texas Rangers, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Midland County Sheriff’s Office. They searched about 60 square miles of remote property by air and ground, issued over a dozen search warrants, and interviewed more than 25 people.</p><p>The police also obtained security camera footage that showed a pickup truck matching the description of Chacon’s truck near an oil company close to Madeline’s apartment around 2 a.m. on May 11. Chacon had previously told the police that he did not leave his home after 11 p.m. on May 10.</p><p>A neighbor also told the police that he heard yelling and screaming from Madeline’s apartment around 1:30 a.m. on May 11. He said that he heard a man and a woman arguing and then heard a woman scream. He added that yelling from Madeline’s apartment was frequent.</p><p>The police interviewed Chacon again on May 12 and confronted him with the evidence. Chacon admitted that he had lied about his alibi and that he had been with Madeline on May 10. He said that they had an argument and that he choked her until she stopped breathing. He then wrapped her body in a comforter and put it in his truck. He drove to a rural area southeast of the city limits and dumped her body in a field.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The Discovery</h3><p>On May 20, nine days after Madeline was reported missing, her remains were found in the field where Chacon had left them. The police arrested Chacon on suspicion of murder on the same day. He is being held without bond at the Midland County Jail.</p><p>An autopsy will be performed in Dallas to determine the cause and manner of Madeline’s death.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The Reaction</h3><p>Madeline’s family and friends are devastated by her loss. They described her as a beautiful, kind, and caring person who loved animals and music. They said that she had dreams of becoming a nurse or a veterinarian.</p><p>They also expressed their gratitude to the law enforcement agencies and the community for their support and efforts in finding Madeline.</p><p>Midland Mayor Lori Blong announced a $20,000 reward for information leading to Madeline’s whereabouts before she was found dead. She said that she could not imagine the stress and worry of Madeline’s family and friends as they went through this ordeal.</p><p>Midland Police Chief Seth Herman said that this was one of the most difficult cases he had ever worked on. He said that he was proud of his team for their dedication and professionalism in solving this case.</p><p>He also urged anyone who is in an abusive relationship to seek help and report any signs of violence.</p><p>According to CNN, People, Crime Online, and Investigation Discovery, this is what happened to Madeline Pantoja, a missing Texas woman who was found dead and whose case shocked and saddened many people.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibkaeypr7GnpirZpiau7CyjZympmeemsS0e9KtpquxX6KupbHLoqWeZaCWu7W7yZpkraCVYsGzrcaimmabkaiybrvFZphmpZmowKq6xmarnrCRqHq4u8yapWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
