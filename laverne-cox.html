She and her twin brother were raised by their mother, Gloria, who was single and worked as a teacher. Though Cox was born biologically male, she had always felt herself to be female, not really seeing a difference between boys and girls. She was often taunted and harassed mercilessly for being feminine, though she was able to hold onto her love for the arts.</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I begged my mother to put me into dance classes and finally, in third grade, she did,” Cox said years later in a Times magazine interview. “Tap and jazz but not ballet. She thought ballet was too gay … Throughout all of that, I was very feminine and I was really bullied, majorly bullied. There was this side of me that was this over-achiever that loved learning.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She attended high school at the Alabama School of Fine Arts before going on to study at Indiana University in Bloomington and Marymount Manhattan College, from which she graduated with a BFA in dance and where her twin pursued studies in visual art.</p><h2 data-node-id title="Movies and TV Shows" data-anchor-id=movies-and-tv-shows class="css-1a93ikt emt9r7s1">Movies and TV Shows</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 2008 Cox appeared on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit before becoming one of the contestants on the reality series I Want to Work for Diddy.

And it feels really good.</li><li>There are lessons in everything. The bad, the good. Our job is to listen, and to continue to learn, so that maybe we get better at this. Maybe get better at life.</li><li>I’m trying to put less pressure on myself and just be myself and trust that I’m enough. And also remember that I do represent a community that isn’t represented much in mainstream media, but also I’m just representing myself and I have to allow myself to be imperfect. I have to allow myself to go outside today with no makeup and that’s okay.</li><li>There’s not just one trans story. There’s not just one trans experience. And I think what they need to understand is that not everybody who is born feels that their gender identity is in alignment with what they’re assigned at birth, based of their genitalia. If someone needs to express their gender in a way that is different, that is okay...</li><li>We have this internal compass of the truth inside of us. And that is our job, really, to quiet all this noise around us and listen to that.</li><li>I absolutely have a lot of work that I have to do around shame, lingering shame from childhood, and childhood trauma. It’s a struggle every day, to stay present, not to become that, you know, 8-year-old who was bullied and chased home from school... But luckily I have tools. I have amazing therapy. And I have support now. I can reach out and talk to people.</li><li>I think the reality is that most of us are insecure about our gender. They think, ‘Okay, if there’s this trans person over here, then what does that make me?’ We want to just coast along in a belief system that makes us feel secure, because we are a culture, as Brene Brown would say, that is intolerant to vulnerability.</li><li>I think a lot of times people assume that because I’m on a TV show or that I’m an actor that I don’t have to deal with the realities of what it means to be a trans person of color in a public space on a daily basis. So for me I was excited to tell the reality of that story [on Orange Is the New Black].</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiYnKyfp8BwrZJwb3JoZWyFcLjAr5yrppVisLDE</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
