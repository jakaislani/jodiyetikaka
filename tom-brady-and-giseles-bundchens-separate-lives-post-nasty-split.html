That is until March 2023, when she gave her first interview post-divorce to <a href=#>Vanity Fair</a>&nbsp;–&nbsp;and it was truly heartbreaking. While many speculated that the supermodel had given her hubby a football-or-family ultimatum, she insisted&nbsp;that simply wasn't the case.&nbsp;"When you love someone, you don't put them in a jail and say, 'You have to live this life.' You set them free to be who they are," she explained in the emotional interview.&nbsp;</p><p>Bündchen added that the rumors that she hated football and had served Brady an ultimatum regarding it were hurtful to her. Not only did she root for his success, but she also went out of her way to learn everything about the game to support him. Instead, she insisted that they had simply grown apart over the years. "What's been said [in the media] is one piece of a much bigger puzzle," Bündchen stated. "It's not so black and white." With their paths diverging, the model set her sights on living&nbsp;a simpler life, which she's been able to accomplish in Costa Rica, one of her favorite places in the world.&nbsp;</p><p>Bundchen also debunked rumors that she's dating businessman, Jeffrey Soffer, as suggested by the&nbsp;<a href=#>Daily Mail</a>.&nbsp;"I have zero relationship with him in any way," she said. "He's Tom's friend, not my friend. I wouldn't be with his friend ... It's ridiculous."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampia396g46tpqZlkqeupcWMmqWdZZeewKa4xKxkm62embCpsc2sZKydoJa%2FosDEZqOirpWoerG70q1kp5mjqcZuv8%2BloK1n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
