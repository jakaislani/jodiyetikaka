I cried while she was coming out, I was so excited to meet her!”</p><p>Hours earlier, the actress wrote that she was experiencing “mother’s intuition” and knew that her baby girl was “coming early.” Austin added, “#‎ChanelNicole is trying to make her appearance.”</p><p>The infant has <a href=#>looked just like her dad from the start,</a> the California native exclusively told Us Weekly in July 2021.</p><p>“She’s looked like her daddy since day one,” Austin explained at the time. “[She was] coming out of the womb looking like him. Now [people] are just noticing after five years. … That’s so weird to me.”</p><p>The Ice Loves Coco alum added that Chanel acts more like her, saying, “She gets on the stage and she rocks on [like Ice-T], but then she, like, has a modeling side too. She has a lot of personality. She tries to act like me. I don’t allow her to do all the poses though. … We like just the cutesy ones.”</p><p>That same month, Austin explained to Us why she and the rapper aren’t “typical parents,” <a href=#>asking other moms and dads not to judge</a> their daughter’s late bedtime.</p><p>“We’re more of night entertainment,” the dancer said. “People have to understand, we have different times. Sometimes, I work until two in the morning. When [Ice-T’s] on tour, he’s doing a show at 12 at night. … So we transfer it a different way. Chanel gets up at 11 in the afternoon.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Hip-Hop Wives alum also defended Chanel’s breast-feeding regimen, saying, “Chanel still likes my boobs.
