And since the announcement of&nbsp;Tower of Fantasy, fans are hoping that this game would be able to stand on its own. However, during the game’s initial launch back in mid-August 2022, fans noticed some similarities and differences that the games share.</p><h3 id=h-is-tower-of-fantasy-like-genshin-impact data-injectable=false>Is Tower of Fantasy like Genshin Impact?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Tower-of-Fantasy-1.jpg><p data-characters=459 data-current-count=759 data-injectable=true>Tower of Fantasy&nbsp;has caught the attention of over 4 million players that pre-registered the game. And while the game is still new, a majority of players who signed up are those who’ve played&nbsp;Genshin Impact&nbsp;in the past. Genshin Impact and Tower of Fantasy have notable similarities such as the various gacha banners that players can pull from, the opening sequence on how one selects their character, and an open world that players are transported to.</p><p data-characters=716 data-current-count=716 data-injectable=true>However, Tower of Fantasy has several features that make it different from Genshin Impact. For starters, the characters you pull are mostly just skins. What you’re really after are the different types of weapons as each of them has a different element and combat style attached to them. Tower of Fantasy doesn’t have teams for you to build, but rather encourages players to team up with others to get through the tougher bosses that surround the area. All you need to do is pick three weapons of your choosing and it’s up to you to decide what type of role you would like to play. Also, you get to customize your avatar to your liking, something that hasn’t been introduced in Genshin Impact.</p><p data-characters=367 data-current-count=367 data-injectable=false>Whether you describe it as ‘The Genshin killer’ or as another option to choose from, Tower of Fantasy has some gameplay elements that make it unique and different from the competition. It’s up to you to choose if you’d want to play something that has stuck around for a while or something new and fresh. Or maybe both, the choice is up to you.</p><p data-characters=73 data-current-count=440 data-injectable=false>Tower of Fantasy&nbsp;is now available on PC, Apple, and Android devices.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZooKxlpKTEpr6MqJ1mnpGjwaK%2F2GajoqOVYrSmutKhoKdlmaK9oq%2FTaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
