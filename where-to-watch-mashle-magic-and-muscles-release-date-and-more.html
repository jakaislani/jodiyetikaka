The teen lost the genetic pool at birth, thus focusing all of his efforts on building his muscles to fight magic itself through strength. Using a self-entitled new role, Mash enrolls on a journey to become a “Divine Visionary,” a new title that this unique society would have no choice but to accept. To achieve this unattainable title, Mash enrolls in Easton Magic Academy but quickly notices he lacks the skills necessary to prosper at this magic school.</p><p data-characters=343 data-current-count=343 data-injectable=false>Throughout this ongoing manga, Mashle: Magic and Muscles shows a unique journey filled with delightful jolliness capable of bringing a smile to anyone’s face.
