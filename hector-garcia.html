During <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii/world-war-ii-history data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="World War II" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">World War II</a> he served in the U.S. Army, and after the war he settled in Corpus Christi, Texas. There, Garcia started a medical practice while also embarking upon a career of civil rights activism after he witnessed the difficulties Mexican American veterans faced when trying to access benefits. Garcia founded the American G.I. Forum in 1948 to advocate for these veterans. The organization — which grew to have chapters across the country and remains active to this day — also worked on causes such as school desegregation and eliminating the poll tax in Texas. Garcia was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1984.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life and Education</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hector Perez Garcia born in Llera, Tamaulipas, Mexico, on January 17, 1914, to Jose Garcia and Faustina Perez Garcia, who were both teachers. The violence of the Mexican Revolution prompted his family to leave Mexico and <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local_news/article/House-recognizes-GI-Forum-founder-Garcia-787767.php data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="legally move" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">legally move</a> to Texas in 1918 when Garcia was 3 years old.

He did well in school, becoming his high school's valedictorian when he graduated in 1932. Garcia later revealed he'd been motivated to succeed in part because a teacher once <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.utmb.edu/drgarcia/educ.htm data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="said to him" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">said to him</a>, "No Mexican will ever make an 'A' in my class."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After studying at Edinburg Junior College, Garcia transferred to the University of Texas and graduated in 1936.

In 1942, during World War II, he volunteered for the U.S. Army. He served in Europe and North Africa and was awarded the Bronze Star.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">His military experiences underlined the importance of equal rights to Garcia. In 1947, he questioned whether some Mexican American casualties in World War II had been the result of these soldiers receiving a lower-quality education in segregated schools, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://books.google.com/books?id=b8MA_vCh_nQC&pg=PA29" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=noting class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">noting</a> that "some of those lives might not have been lost" if they "would have been better equipped and trained to defend themselves."</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">American G.I. Forum</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Garcia moved to Corpus Christi, Texas, following the end of World War II. He set up a medical practice and joined the League of United Latin American Citizens. One of LULAC's goals was to fight discrimination. However, Garcia felt <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/taro/tamucc/00005/tcc-00005.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="more action was needed" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">more action was needed</a> to assist Mexican American veterans who were having trouble accessing Veterans Administration services, such as the G.I. Bill, home loans, and treatment at V.A. hospitals. To address these issues he founded the American G.I. Forum in March 1948.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In January 1949, Garcia contacted the media and public figures, including then-Senator <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/lyndon-b-johnson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Lyndon B.

It also demonstrated the power of the American G.I. Forum.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The American G.I. Forum, whose <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.humanitiestexas.org/programs/tx-originals/list/hector-p-garcia data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=motto class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">motto</a> was "Education is our Freedom, and Freedom Should be Everybody's Business," went on to engage in other civil rights battles. They fought to desegregate schools and brought a case that resulted in a Supreme Court ruling that Mexican Americans could not be kept from serving on Texas grand juries. The organization also campaigned against the poll tax in Texas and encouraged voting with registration drives.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The American G.I.

However, this didn't keep Garcia from supporting Johnson in the 1964 election via "Viva Johnson" clubs.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While Johnson was president, he appointed Garcia as an alternate delegate to the United Nations.
